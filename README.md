    <h3>Abaut Get next line 'GNL':</h3>
    <p>
        The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis project is understand the concept of static variables.<br>
        'GNL' takes a file descriptor and return a string contains one complete text line (until the next line break ['\n' char]). when use again return the next line, and like this, as many times as we want or until the end of the text. The subject says that we have to use always the same buffersize (chars that can be read each time), and our function should read as few times as possible each time be used, for this reason, we should save the part of line that we read if the function not found the '\n' first time that we used it, or the rest part of the next line if the buffersize is large than first position of '\n'char, for attach it to next line next time that 'GNL' read...ü§Ø<br><br>
        ...ü§îMaby better if I explain you with an example, right?<br>
        If we have the next text in the opened file:<br>
        <img src=".readmedata/1st_img.png"><br>
        And we should to use this time for eample a buffersize of 7, our fuction can't get the first complete line and should save this chars:<br>
        <img src=".readmedata/2nd_img.png"><br>
        At this point our funtion can't return a complete line, then should read again:<br>
        <img src=".readmedata/3th_img.png"><br>
        And return a line attaching the first was be saved with the last was be readed until '\n', and save the two chars that was read from next line.<br>
